The Bunker Project has completed transition to the [Ansible][1],
as the single tool for unified infrastructure management.

"[Infrastructure as Code][2]" approach brings significant benefits.
New physical and virtual servers got configured automatically.
Configuration management for new and existing servers is made
from the single source.

Automation refers to setting up web hosting, DNS,
creating user accounts, etc.
